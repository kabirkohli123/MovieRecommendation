## Introduction

Movie recommendation systems are integral to streaming platforms and online movie databases. By analyzing user preferences and movie features, this project builds a recommendation system that can suggest movies tailored to individual tastes.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Suggests movies based on the features and attributes of movies that a user has liked in the past.
- **Hybrid Model:** Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.
- **User Interface:** Provides a simple interface where users can input their preferences and receive recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kabirkohli123/movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the recommendation algorithms:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MovieRecom.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and generate movie recommendations.

3. (Optional) Run the Flask app for the user interface:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
